OBJECTIVE: find the FLAG.

By the way, `cacaview` is an interesting utility for viewing image files from the command line as ASCII art. It won't help you much though.

I hid the flag somewhere HUGE. It'll be hiding in plain sight.

I'm completely obsessed with cyber-security! Not to brag, but I'll give an example =3
I have a second HTTPS server running on some obscure port. Port twelve-thousand something, not telling you XD.
And yes, it's HTTPS, not HTTP... HTTP is legacy technology. Get hip with it bruh ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
And to access my super-secret stuff, you've gotta know the 32 character long password.
It's a mix of letters and numbers...

Okay, that's enough about me.
What's your favorite food? 

M ine's potato! I LOVE POTATO. With garlic, butter. Baked, fried, no... HASHED.
D-elicious. I eat like 
5 potatoes a day.

Are potatoes high in fiber? Maybe that would help with DIGESTION.

Fun fact about me - all my usernames are potato. You'll never guess that my password though, so whatevs.
